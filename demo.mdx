## Sam's Car Dealership Example

The easiest way to get started is on the [app.hamming.ai](https://app.hamming.ai/datasets?page=1)


In this example, we will be implementing a test agent for a car dealership service. The test agent will call to schedule an appointment at Sam’s Car Dealership.

Sam's Car Dealership offers a range of vehicle services, including maintenance and repairs for customers, while also providing leasing options and selling both new and used cars. Their agent can schedule appointments and collect customer information.

| Vehicle Services  | Sales  | 
|------------|------------|
| Oil Change | Lease |
| Brake Inspections | Buy|
| Tire Rotations |  |

    The dataset should accurately represent the calls. The more detailed the dataset, the better it       will allow us to test it. Since each business is unique, you can upload as many columns as needed     and then map them as input columns shown in the next steps.
    <Tip>
      **Tip**: Hamming accepts CSV & JSON files up to 10MB. All files should have a header.
