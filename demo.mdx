## Sam's Car Dealership ðŸš—

Sam's Car Dealership offers a range of vehicle services, including maintenance and repairs for customers, while also providing leasing options and selling both new and used cars. Their agent can schedule appointments and collect customer information.

| Vehicle Services  | Sales     | 
|------------|------------------|
| Oil Change | Lease            |
| Brake Inspections | Buy       |
| Tire Rotations |              | 


In this example, we will build a Hamming test agent to evaluate how well the virtual voice agent schedules appointments for its customers. 

### Components to Building a Hamming Test Agent

<CardGroup>
  
  <Card 
  title="Datasets" 
  icon="square-1">
  Datasets are a collection of customer phone calls/scenarios that you want to test. You can upload an existing dataset in 
   CSV or JSON format or create a new dataset using JSON.
  </Card>

  <Card 
  title="Scoring Prompts" 
  icon="square-2">
 To evaluate your virtual voice agent you need to create prompts for the Hamming test agent defining the task and success criteria. The Hamming test agent will follow these instructions during evaluation.
  </Card>

  <Card 
  title="Scorer" 
  icon="square-3">
  The scorer is a tool used to assess the performance of the virtual voice agent. The scorer evaluates the agent's responses by comparing them to the expected outputs defined in the prompt.
  </Card>

<Card 
  title="Voice Agents" 
  icon="square-4">
  To test your virtual voice agent, the Hamming test agent will simulate multiple interactions using the scenarios provided in your dataset. You'll need to configure a prompt for the Hamming test agent with input variables from your dataset, allowing it to explore a variety of customer situations.

<Steps>
  <Step title= "Create A Dataset">
    
    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/datasets](https://app.hamming.ai/datasets?page=1) to create a dataset.
    2. Click on **+Add New Dataset**. You can either upload an existing dataset or create an empty dataset and then use the JSON editor to build your dataset.
       The dataset should contain **all phone calls** you'd like to use in your test. Since each business is 
      unique, you can upload as many columns as needed and then map them as input columns shown in the video.
    3. Enter a dataset name and description (optional)
    4. Select the input columns. The input columns are the data points you'd like to validate in your test.

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: Hamming accepts CSV & JSON files up to 10MB. All files should have a header.

  </Step>

 <Step title="Create A Prompt" >
    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/prompts](http://app.hamming.ai/prompts) to create a prompt.
       The prompt should be clear and concise instructions for the test agent.  
    2. Click on **+Add Prompt**
    3. Enter a prompt name and description (optional)
    4. Select the model that you want to use to evaluate the agent
    5. Add a system prompt. E.g. You are a friendly receptionist at a car dealership
    6. Add a user prompt. Make sure that your user prompt has two main components: [TASK] & [CRITERIA]  

    **[TASK]** This describes the task to the test agent _e.g. Analzye the call between a receptionist and a customer_
    **[CRITERIA]** This defines what makes the call successful. _e.g. Was the receptionist able to schedule an appointment?      1 - Yes; 0 - No;_

    7. Save the prompt and deploy to production

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: We recommend using gpt-4o to obtain the best results

  </Step>

<Step title="Create A Scorer">

    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/evals](http://app.hamming.ai/evals) to create a scorer
    2. Click on **+Add Scorer**
    3. Enter a prompt name and description (optional)
    4. Add values and labels which will be used to display the results of the test
    5. Select the prompt you created in Step 2 and set the prompt label to **production**
    6. Change the Variable Mappings field to **Output** and enter **transcript** in the field on the right. This will pull 
       the data from the dataset you uploaded in Step 1

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: Ensure that the values in the scorer align with the labels from your prompt. For example, if the value "0" represents "No" in your prompt, make sure the scorer also labels "0" as "No."

  </Step>

<Step title="Create A Voice Agent">

    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/voice-agents](http://app.hamming.ai/voice-agents) to set up a test agent
    2. Click on **+Add Voice Agent**
    3. Enter a name 
    4. Select **Function** from the Scoring dropdown
    5. Enter a prompt for the customer. This prompt should be instructions for the customer calling the 
       dealership. Plug in the input columns as variables like in this example and set rules of what the
       customer should be saying. If you need more help, follow this template.
    6. Select the dataset you uploaded in Step 1.
    7. Click on Run and enter the phone number you'd like to test it with. You can set up a phone number
       on Retell AI. 

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: If you want to speak to the customer, you can enter your own phone number and the system will call your phone.
