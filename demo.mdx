## Sam's Car Dealership Example

Sam's Car Dealership offers a range of vehicle services, including maintenance and repairs for customers, while also providing leasing options and selling both new and used cars. Their agent can schedule appointments and collect customer information.

| Vehicle Services  | Sales     | 
|------------|------------------|
| Oil Change | Lease            |
| Brake Inspections | Buy       |
| Tire Rotations |              | 


In this example, we will implement a test agent for a car dealership service. The test agent will call to schedule an appointment at Samâ€™s Car Dealership.

them as input columns shown in the next steps.
