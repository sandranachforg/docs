## Sam's Car Dealership Voice Agent

Sam's Car Dealership offers a range of vehicle services, including maintenance and repairs for customers, while also providing leasing options and selling both new and used cars. Their agent can schedule appointments and collect customer information.

| Vehicle Services  | Sales     | 
|------------|------------------|
| Oil Change | Lease            |
| Brake Inspections | Buy       |
| Tire Rotations |              | 


In this example, we will implement a test agent for a car dealership service. The test agent will call to schedule an appointment at Samâ€™s Car Dealership.


<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Create A Dataset">
    
    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/datasets](https://app.hamming.ai/datasets?page=1)
    2. Click on **+Add New Dataset** . You can either upload an existing dataset or create a new one using the JSON 
       editor. The dataset should contain **all phone calls** you'd like to use in your test. Since each business is 
      unique, you can upload as many columns as needed and then map them as input columns shown in the video.
    3. Enter a name and description (optional).
    4. Select the input columns. The input columns are the data points you'd like to validate in your test.

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: Hamming accepts CSV & JSON files up to 10MB. All files should have a header.
