## Sam's Car Dealership Example

Sam's Car Dealership offers a range of vehicle services, including maintenance and repairs for customers, while also providing leasing options and selling both new and used cars. Their agent can schedule appointments and collect customer information.

| Vehicle Services  | Sales     | 
|------------|------------------|
| Oil Change | Lease            |
| Brake Inspections | Buy       |
| Tire Rotations |              | 


In this example, we will implement a test agent for a car dealership service. The test agent will call to schedule an appointment at Sam’s Car Dealership.

  <Accordion title="2. Create A Dataset"">
    The dataset should accurately represent the calls. The more detailed the dataset, the better it       will 
    allow us to test it. Since each business is unique, you can upload as many columns as needed     and then map 
    them as input columns shown in the next steps.
