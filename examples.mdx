## Sam's Car Dealership ðŸš—

Sam's Car Dealership offers a range of vehicle services, including maintenance and repairs for customers, while also providing leasing options and selling both new and used cars. Their agent can schedule appointments and collect customer information.

In this example, we will build a Hamming test agent **taking on the role of the customer** to evaluate how well the virtual voice agent schedules appointments for Sam's customers. 


### Components of the Voice Test Agent

  A dataset is a collection of customer phone call scenarios that you want Hamming's test agent to simulate. You can upload an existing dataset in 
   CSV or JSON format or create a new one from the UI.
  </Card>

  <Card 
  title="Scoring Prompts" 
  icon="square-2">
 To evaluate your virtual voice agent you need to create prompts that define the success criteria for each call. This is critical to ensure your virtual voice agent is evaluated only on the things that matter to your business.

  <Card 
  title="Scorer" 
  icon="square-3">
  The scorer wraps a scoring prompt and adds configuration knobs to control how your voice agent is evaluated.

<Card 
  title="Hamming Test Agent" 
  icon="square-4">
  To test your virtual voice agent, the Hamming test agent will simulate multiple interactions using the scenarios provided in your dataset. Remember, Hamming's test agent **takes on the role of your customers!**

 <Step title="Create A Scoring Prompt" >

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: We recommend using gpt-4o with temperature 0 to get the best results.

</Tip>

    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/prompts](http://app.hamming.ai/prompts) to create a scoring prompt.
       The prompt should contain concise instructions for the scorer.
    2. Click on **+Add Prompt**.
    3. Enter a prompt name and description.
    4. Select the model that you want to use to evaluate your virtual voice agent.
    5. Add a system prompt.

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="System Prompt">
```
You are an expert data analyst, with 30 years of experience analyzing phone call transcripts. You have a great attention to details.
```
</Accordion>

    6. Add a user prompt.


<Warning>

**Important**: The output of the prompt must be an XML structure like described below.

</Warning>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="User Prompt">
  ```
[TASK]
You are given the <transcript> of a phone call between a receptionist (HUMAN) and a customer (BOT).
Your task is to classify the transcript of the phone call, given the [CRITERIA]. 

[CRITERIA]
Was the receptionist (HUMAN) able to schedule an appointment for the customer? 1 - Yes; 0 - No;
If there is not enough information in the transcript to determine the correct classification, label as 2 - N/A;

Assign one of the labels above and provide reasoning for why the call should be assigned that label.

[INPUT]
<transcript>
{{transcript}}
</transcript>

[OUTPUT]
<score>
<reason>

  </Step>

<Step title="Create A Scorer">

<Warning>

**Important**: Ensure that the values in the scorer align with the labels from your scoring prompt. For example, if the value "0" represents "No" in your prompt, make sure the scorer also labels "0" as "No."

</Warning>

    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/evals](http://app.hamming.ai/evals) to create a scorer, which simply acts as a wrapper for the scoring prompt.
    2. Click on **+Add Scorer**.
    3. Enter a scorer name and description.
    4. Add values and labels which will be used to display the results of the test.
    5. Select the scoring prompt you created in Step 2 and set the prompt label to **production**.
    6. Change the Variable Mappings field to **Output** and enter **transcript** in the field on the right.
