### Set up Voice Monitoring

Voice Monitoring enables you to assess the reliability of your AI voice agent. By following a few simple steps, you can set up monitoring on Hamming.AI to track your agent's performance. Monitoring provides Hume scoring, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness of your voice agent.

<Warning>

**Important**: We currently only support monitoring for Retell AI Agents.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

<Steps>

<Step title= "1. Initiate Agent Test Run">

This initiates a series of parallel calls, referred to as a **Voice Experiment**.

```
POST https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{agent_id}

Request Body:
{ "to_number": "+12063991234", "dataset_id": "{dataset_id}"}

Response:
{ "voice_experiment_id" }

```


  </Step>

 <Step title="2. Obtain Voice Experiment Status" >

This endpoint can be used to check the status of the Voice Experiment.


  ```
GET https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{voice_experiment_id}

Response:
{ "id": "voice_experiment_id", "status": "FINISHED" }

```
 
  </Step>

<Step title="3. Obtain Voice Experiment Calls">

After the experiment is **FINISHED**, you can retrieve the score results for the experiment.

```
GET https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{voice_experiment_id}/calls

Response:
{
    "calls": [
       // Array of calls that were run as part of the voice experiment
       // Each call object will include the scoring status.
    ]
}
```

  </Step>
