<Steps>

<Step title= "1. Start Agent Test Run">

This will start a set of calls in parallel - we call it a Voice Experiment.
```
POST https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{agent_id}

Request Body:
{ "to_number": "+12063991234", "dataset_id": "{dataset_id}"}

Response:
{ "voice_experiment_id" }

```


  </Step>

 <Step title="2. Get Voice Experiment" >

You can use this endpoint to poll for the Voice Experiment status.

  ```
GET https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{voice_experiment_id}

Response:
{ "id": "voice_experiment_id", "status": "FINISHED" }

```
 
  </Step>

<Step title="3. Get Voice Experiment Calls">

Once the experiment is FINISHED, you can query the score results for the experiment.

```
GET https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{voice_experiment_id}/calls

Response:
{
    "calls": [
       // Array of calls that were run as part of the voice experiment
       // Each call object will include the scoring status.
    ]
}
```

  </Step>
