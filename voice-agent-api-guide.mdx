## Voice Agent API Guide

### Run a Hamming Test Agent programmatically


<Warning>

**Important**: Before using the API to run your Hamming test agent, you must first set up your test agent. You can follow this template for a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of how to create a dataset and set up a prompt, scorer and voice agent.(https://docs.hamming.ai/guides/voice-agent).

</Warning>

### Things You Need to Succeed

In order to set up and run a Hamming voice agent programmatically, you need to have your dataset ID and agent ID ready.

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Finding your Agent ID">

To find your agent ID follow these steps: 

</Accordion>



<Steps>

<Step title= "Start Agent Test Run">


<Tip>

**Important**: This will start a set of calls in parallel - we call it a Voice Experiment.

</Tip>

```
POST https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{agent_id}

Request Body:
{ "to_number": "+12063991234", "dataset_id": "{dataset_id}"}

Response:
{ "voice_experiment_id" }```


  </Step>

 <Step title="Get Voice Experiment" >

You can use this endpoint to poll for the Voice Experiment status.

```
GET https://app.hamming.ai/api/rest/voice-experiment/{voice_experiment_id}

Response:
{ "id": "voice_experiment_id", "status": "FINISHED" }
```



    6. Add a user prompt.


<Warning>

**Important**: The result of the prompt should be structured as an XML format, as outlined below.

</Warning>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="User Prompt">
  ```
[TASK]
You are given the <transcript> of a phone call between a receptionist (HUMAN) and a customer (BOT).
Your task is to classify the transcript of the phone call, given the [CRITERIA]. 

[CRITERIA]
Was the receptionist (HUMAN) able to schedule an appointment for the customer? 1 - Yes; 0 - No;
If there is not enough information in the transcript to determine the correct classification, label as 2 - N/A;

Assign one of the labels above and provide reasoning for why the call should be assigned that label.

[INPUT]
<transcript>
{{transcript}}
</transcript>

[OUTPUT]
<score>
<reason>
Find evidence in the transcript to prove whether the interviewer succeeded or failed to meet the criteria.
Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation for assigning a label, based on the available evidence or the absence of it.
</reason>
<value>
0 | 1 | 2
</value>

```

</Accordion>

    7. Save the prompt and deploy to production.

  </Step>

<Step title="Create A Scorer">

<Warning>

**Important**: Ensure that the values in the scorer align with the labels from your scoring prompt. For example, if the value "0" represents "No" in your prompt, make sure the scorer also labels "0" as "No."

</Warning>

    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/evals](http://app.hamming.ai/evals) to create a scorer, which simply acts as a wrapper for the scoring prompt.
    2. Click on **+Add Scorer**.
    3. Enter a scorer name and description.
    4. Add values and labels which will be used to display the results of the test.
    5. Select the scoring prompt you created in Step 2 and set the prompt label to **production**.
    6. Change the Variable Mappings field to **Output** and enter **transcript** in the field on the right.

<Step title="Create A Hamming Test Agent">

<Tip>

**Pro Tip**: If you want to speak to Hamming's test agent, you can enter your own phone number and Hamming's test agent will call you.

</Tip>

    1. Visit [app.hamming.ai/voice-agents](http://app.hamming.ai/voice-agents) to set up a Hamming test agent (customer).
    2. Click on **+Add Voice Agent**.
    3. Enter a name.
    4. Select **Function** from the Scoring dropdown and select the scorer you created in the previous step.
    5. Configure a prompt for the Hamming test agent with input variables from your dataset, allowing it to simulate a 
       variety of customer situations. We recommend using the format below.

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Test Agent (Customer) Prompt">
  ```
You are calling a car dealership and talking to the front-desk assistant. Follow the scenario below:

Your name: {name}
Department you want to talk to: {department_name}
Buying / Leasing interest: {buy_or_lease}
Your Customer Status: {existing_customer}
Your budget for buying car: {budget}
Your phone number: {phone_number}
When to schedule appointment: {appointment_schedule}
Service Requested: {type_of_service}


[RULES]
Only answer questions when you are asked. Don't disclose any information without being asked first.
Say goodbye at the end.
